# Build The Earth Guide

Hey! If you're here, you're probably looking for the source, aren't you? Looking to contribute? Perfect!

## Contributing

We're using Sphinx with ReadTheDocs to run the Guide. For those unfamiliar with it, we suggest you look 

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We've included `sphinx-autobuild` with the guide, if you want to utilise the live-reload, run `make livehtml` and visit http://localhost:8000 to see your changes.
